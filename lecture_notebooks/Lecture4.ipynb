Since the lowest-order terms in the Taylor expansion typically dominate, an integration method that integrates those terms perfectly will be more accurate than one that neglects all terms above $N=1$.  (We're looking at you, trapezoid rule!)\n"

    "\n",
    "Usually the relative error is defined as \"(numerical-exact)/exact,\" but sometimes we do not know the exact value.  In those cases, we can hope that we are approaching the exact value with our approximations.  We can define our relative error as \"(`this_iteration`-`previous_iteration`)/`this_iteration`.\"  We divide by `this_iteration` because of our assumption that we are approaching the exact value.\n",

    "As with all numerical algorithms, the integration algorithms stop converging when round-off error starts to dominate.  The desired accuracy should be set with the round-off error in mind.\n",

    "If you just need the precision to \"N decimal places,\" then the appropriate metric is the difference (`this_iteration`-`previous_iteration`).  This will give you the correct absolute precision regardless of the result's magnitude."
